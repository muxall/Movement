</br>
This repo is associated with the YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aUZqdsquT11l7CI8v8KFQ"> Muxall Open IoT Video Blog </a>. </br>
</br>
Our goal is to build the <a href="https://youtu.be/e44HD0biEdk"> Muxall Movement </a> from the ground up; hardware, software and enclosure, documenting the entire process in videos and having some fun along the way.</br>
