Muxall Movement Repo</br>
</br>
This repo is associated with the YouTube channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aUZqdsquT11l7CI8v8KFQ"> Muxall Open IoT Video Blog </a>. </br>
</br>
Our goal is to build the <a href="https://youtu.be/e44HD0biEdk"> Muxall Movement </a> from the ground up; hardware, software and enclosure, documenting the entire process in videos and having some fun along the way.</br>
</br>
Why is this project useful?  This project is all about learning and sharing.   From PCB design and writing software, to using a CNC Mill and finishing our exotic wooden enclosure, we will cover it all.</br>
</br>
To get started, go to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_aUZqdsquT11l7CI8v8KFQ"> Muxall Open IoT Video Blog </a>, subscribe to our channel, watch the first few videos to find out how to download the GitHub files for the various videos that interest you, and start commenting and contributing.</br>
